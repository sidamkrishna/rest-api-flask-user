 Compared to Django


| Setup          | Just 1 file (app.py), quick to start         | Many files (views.py, urls.py, etc.) |
| Structure      | You decide (no rules)                        | Strict structure                    |
| REST API       | You code it by hand                          | You use Django REST Framework       |
| Best for       | Learning, small apps, quick APIs             | Big apps, admin panels, serious stuff |
| Speed to build | ðŸ”¥ Super fast                                | ðŸ§± Takes time to set up              |
